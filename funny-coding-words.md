* [Bug](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_bug#Etymology) - an error or malfunction in a program or system that causes incorrect or unexpected results. It was used to describe a "little fault" by Thomas Edison [as far back as 1876](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_bug#Etymology), but within software engineering its use is attributed to Grace Hopper who in 1947 told the story of a malfunction being caused due to a moth being trapped in a relay during her work at Harvard; the moth was removed, and taped to the account of the error in the log book. 

C

* [camelCase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CamelCase) - the convention of writing compound words or phrases with no spaces between the words, starting with an initial lowercase letter and each remaining word element beginning with an uppercase letter, eg. iPod.


* [Cargo cult programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_cult_programming) - "a style of computer programming characterized by the ritual inclusion of code or program structures that serve no real purpose"
* [Cowboy coding](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?CowboyCoder) - programmers who write code according to their own rules. They may be very good at writing code, but they don't generally follow standard processes or policies.


D

* [Duck typing](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?DuckTyping) - from the principle, "if it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck then it is a duck", it is the convention of assuming that an object will behave in a particular way based on its behaviour at a certain time.
